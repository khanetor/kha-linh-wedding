# Kha & Linh Wedding

## Project Structure
- **Framework**: [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) (Markdown and Vue)
- **Styling**: Vitepress default with Catppuccin theme
- **Package Manager**: bun

## Architecture Notes
- The default language is English, and the markdown files are mostly created in the root directory.
- The second language is Vietnamese, and the markdown files are in the `/vi/` directory.

## Development Guidelines
- There are 2 languages being used: English, and Vietnamese, so always consider this when creating contents.
- You can add pending changes to git, but **DO NOT** try to call git commit unless I explicitly tell you to do so.
